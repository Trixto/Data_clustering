# Data_clustering
This repository contains a clustering analysis script implemented in Python. The script performs various data preprocessing steps, including feature selection, PCA, and correlation analysis. It then applies t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering to identify patterns and clusters in the data. The results are visualized using scatter plots and heatmaps. The code is designed to analyze radiology data and can be easily customized for other datasets
